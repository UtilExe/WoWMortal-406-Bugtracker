Before you make a report please read this:

● Make sure your report contains proper information, details about the bug you're about to create. 

● Tell us what is exactly bugging, and how it's supposed to be. 
- Please do not write something as "spell x doesn't work" instead you should write "spell x doesn't work at all, it's completly useless" or another way to report it would be writting something as "spell x only gives 2% stamina but not 2% strength" (My point is, give us a detailed report)

● Don't ask when something will be fixed 
-It will be fixed as soon as possible, or when there's time to look into it)

● Don't post more than one bug in a report you have created. 
- If you know more bugs, open a new report and post the other bug there.
